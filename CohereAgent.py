Instructions:
- Use the explanations as the authoritative source for each set.
- Maintain chronological order of the sets.
- Clearly label each set in the document (e.g., "Set 1", "Set 2", etc.).
- Include all relevant details about cursor movements, selections, text input, scrolls, menu/dialog interactions, and inferred user actions.
- Ensure the LaTeX document is well-structured, clear, and concise.
- Include sections, enumerated lists, or subsections for readability.
- Format code blocks, terminal output, or text input using appropriate LaTeX environments (e.g., verbatim or lstlisting) if mentioned in the explanations.
- Avoid adding information not present in the explanations.
- Produce the complete LaTeX output in one response.
- Do not reference screenshots directly; rely entirely on the provided explanations.

The explanation should be clear, concise, and complete enough for someone else to understand the sequence of user actions and their effects.

Instructions:
- Compare earliest and latest screenshots carefully to identify changes.
- Include all relevant observations:
  - Cursor movements: starting/ending positions, icon changes
  - Active window/tab changes
  - Text changes: per-character typing, block insertion, paste, or autocomplete
  - Selections or dragged items
  - Scrolling or content shifts
  - Menus, dialogs, tooltips, or hover states
  - Prior mouse or keyboard input that likely caused the changes
- Include your inference of the most likely user action(s) and any timing/plausibility notes.
- Present the explanation as a concise paragraph or structured sentences (3â€“6 sentences recommended).
- Do not generate LaTeX at this stage.
- Focus only on this single set; do not reference other sets."""
